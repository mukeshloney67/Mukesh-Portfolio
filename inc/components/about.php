                <p class="roboto">I'm Mukesh, a full stack developer with a strong foundation in UI/UX design and a passion for building responsive, user-centric web apps. I enjoy crafting clean interfaces using React and Tailwind, and powering them with scalable backends using Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. Over time, I’ve worked on everything from edtech platforms to real-time dashboards — handling both design and development end-to-end. Currently, I’m focused on sharpening my skills in TypeScript and backend architecture, constantly pushing to create better digital experiences.</p>
